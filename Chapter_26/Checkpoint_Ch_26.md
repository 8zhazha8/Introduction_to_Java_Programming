AVL trees are a form of BST tree but always well-balanced. In an AVL tree, the difference between the heights of two subtrees for every node is 0 or 1.  

The balance factor of a node is the height of its right subtree minus the height of its left subtree.  

A node is said to be balanced if its balance factor is -1, 0, or 1.  

A node is said to be left-heavy if its balance factor is -1.  

A node is said to be right-heavy if its balance factor is +1.
