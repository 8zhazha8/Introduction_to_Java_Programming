## 10.1 ##
A subclass is usually not a subset of a superclass. Subclasses will usually add functionality and details that are not present in the superclass thus extending the superclass.  

## 10.2 ##
The keyword extends is used when defining a subclass.  

For example:  
```Java  
public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {
	
	// ...
	// ...
	// ...

}
```

Single inheritance means that a class may only inherit from one particular class.  

Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one  parent class.  

Multiple inheritance is not supported by the Java programming language.
