Insertion sort works the same way as one would sort a hand of cards, i.e. starting with an empty left hand and the cards in the deck face down on the table. One card at a time is then dealt from the table and inserted into the correct position in the left hand. To find the correct position for a card, it is compared with each of the cards already in the hand, from right to left.  

The time complexity for insertion sort is O(n^2).
