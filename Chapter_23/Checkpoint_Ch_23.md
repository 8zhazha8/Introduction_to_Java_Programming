Insertion sort works the same way as one would sort a hand of cards, i.e. starting with an empty left hand and the cards in the deck face down on the table. One card at a time is then dealt from the table and inserted into the correct position in the left hand. To find the correct position for a card, it is compared with each of the cards already in the hand, from right to left.  

The time complexity for insertion sort is O(n^2).

Bubble sort will repeatedly step through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.  

The time complexity for a bubble sort is O(n^2).
