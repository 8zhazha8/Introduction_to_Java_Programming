# Checkpoint Answers Chapter 12 #
## 12.1 ##
Exceptions provide the means to separate the details of what to do when something out of the ordinary happens from the main logic of a program. This separation can, if used right, simplify the code making it easier to understand and maintain.  

## 12.2 ##
The following statement will throw an exception because of the division with zero.  
```Java  
System.out.println(1 / 0);  
```
Division of doubles will on the other hand not throw an exception when dividing by zero. This is because the specification that Java follows specifies that this event shall return a special indicator indicating infinity.  
```Java
System.out.println(1.0 / 0);    
```
The above line will not throw an exception. The output from a test run was:
```  
Infinity  
```
