# Answers to the checkpoint questions in chapter 1 #
**1.1**  
A computer is said to be made up of hardware and software. 

Hardware are the different devices either installed in or connected to the computer. For example the drives, screen, keyboard, and motherboard.

Software is a set of instructions that are interpreted and executed by the hardware.

**1.2**  
Five major computer hardware components are  
1. Processor  
2. Memory  
3. Hard drive  
4. Screen  
5. Keyboard   

**1.3**  
CPU stands for Central Processing Unit.

**1.4**  
One unit used when measuring CPU speed is Hertz.  

**1.5**  
A bit is the basic unit of information in computing. A bit can only have one of two values. These values are commonly represented as 0 or 1.  

A byte is a unit of information in computing that most commonly consists of eight bits.  

**1.6**  
Memory is special hardware used for holding information while executing a software. RAM stands for Random Access Memory. The name RAM indicates that any part of the memory can be read and written in roughly the same amount of time.  

**1.7**  
Memory size is, at the time of writing, often measured in gigabyte (GB).  
  
**1.8**  
The unit to measure disk size is, at the time of writing, often measured in gigabyte (GB) or terabyte (TB).  

**1.9**  
The difference between memory and a storage device is usually that a memory will lose its content if the computer is powered off as opposed to a storage device where the memory is more or less permanent.  

**1.10**  
The CPU only understand instructions written in machine language. Each CPU family uses its own version of the machine language.  

**1.11**  
Assembly language is a low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the language and the architecture's machine code.  

**1.12**  
An assembler translates assembly-language instructions into machine code.  

**1.13**  
The main difference between a high-level language and a low level language is that the former is platform independent and written in a more human friendly way.  

**1.14**  
A source program is a program written in a high-level language that needs further transformation before the computer can use it.  

**1.15**  
An interpreter translates small parts of source code, more or less line by line, into machine code that then are executed by the computer directly.  

**1.16**  
A compiler takes one or more files with high level source code and builds a machine language program that is stored in a file. This machine code file is then used at a later stage when the program shall run.  

**1.17**  
The difference between a compiler and interpreter is that an interpreter works with translation of source code to machine code in real time while the program is running. An compiler will be finished with the entire translation before the program runs.  

**1.18**  
An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is an essential component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs usually require an operating system to function.  

Some currently popular operating systems are Windows, Linux, and Android.

**1.19**  
An operating system is responsible for handling of input/output devices such as keyboard mouse and screen. An operating system will also often make it possible to run several programs at once by letting each program use the CPU in short intervals and giving each application some memory that the application is allowed to read and write. An operating system is often also responsible for security, preventing unauthorized access to the system.  
 
**1.20**  
Multiprogramming allows multiple programs to run simultaneously by sharing the same
CPU.  

Multithreading allows a single program to execute multiple tasks at the same time. In a game so can for example one task be responsible for playing sounds. While another task updates the graphics.  

Multiprocessing, or parallel processing, uses two or more processors together to perform subtasks concurrently and then combine solutions of the subtasks to obtain a solution for the entire task.  

**1.21**  
Initial development of Java was done at Sun Microsystems and the work was lead by James Gosling.  

Java is currently owned and developed by a company called Oracle.  

**1.22**  
A Java applet is a small application which is written in Java and delivered to the users over the Web. The user launches the Java applet from a web page, and the applet is then executed within in a process separate from the web browser itself.  

**1.23** 
Java is often used when developing Android applications.
