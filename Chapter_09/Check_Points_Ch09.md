## 9.1 ##
Objects of the same type are defined using a common class. A class is a template, blueprint, or contract that defines what an objectâ€™s data fields and methods will be.  

An object is an instance of a class. It is possible to create many instances of a class.  

## 9.2 ##
A class is defined by the use of the class keyword followed by the name of the class. For example:
```Java  
public class MyClass {  
	// constructors, class variables, and methods goes here  
}  
```  

## 9.3 ##
A reference variable for an object is declared by the use of the class name followed by the name of the object. For example:  
```Java  
MyClass mc;  
```  

## 9.4 ##
The new keyword in combination with a class constructor is used to create an object. For example:  
```Java  
MyClass mc = new MyClass();  
```  

## 9.5 ##
Constructors are special methods that are used to create objects of an class.  

An ordinary method will have a return type but constructors does not, not even void.
