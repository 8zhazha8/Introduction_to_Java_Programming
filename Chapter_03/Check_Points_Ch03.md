Examples of relational operators are:
```
<    less than  
<=   less than or equal to  
>    greater than  
>=   greater than or equal to  
==   equal to  
!=   not equal to
```

Below are some Boolean expressions with comments about the resulting values.  
```
x = 1  
(x > 0)   // true  
(x < 0)   // false
(x != 0)  // true
(x >= 0)  // true
(x != 1)  // false
```  

**3.3**  
It is now allowed to cast from an boolean to an int in Java, neither is it allowed to cast from an int to an boolean.  

This means that the following program will not compile.  
```Java  
public class CheckPoint_03_03 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		boolean b = true;
		i = (int)b;					// error
		
		int i = 1;
		boolean b = (boolean)i;		// error
	}

}

```  
**3.4**  
An if statement that assigns 1 to x if y is greater than 0:  
```Java
if(y > 0)  
	x = 1;  
```
