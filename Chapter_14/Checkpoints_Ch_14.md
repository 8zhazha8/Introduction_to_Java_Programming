The initial version of the GUI library was known as the Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT). Maps Java code to each operating system's real GUI system. Limited to lowest common denominator among the supported system's.  

After AWT came another version called Swing. Paints all GUI components by itself instead of relying on the underlying operating system. 

Swing is now being replaced by a third version called JavaFX. JavaFX aims to be better suited for today's systems with for example multi-touch support.
